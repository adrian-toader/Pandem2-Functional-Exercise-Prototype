        <p>To run a simulation, begin by setting a baseline scenario. Under Actions, choose Configure and run a new scenario. Choose model parameters, add a name and a description, run the scenario and view the results. Results include both epidemiological indicators such as cases and deaths, and estimated demand on hospital resources. If you would like to experiment with different policies, create an alternative scenario, change some of the model settings, and run again to compare results. Create your own visualisations using the Exploration section at the bottom of the page.</p>
