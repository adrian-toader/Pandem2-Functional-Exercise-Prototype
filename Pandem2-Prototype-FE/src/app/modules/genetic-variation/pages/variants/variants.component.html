          <strong> Variants of Concern (VOC)</strong>
          <p>
            For these variants, clear evidence is available indicating a significant impact on transmissibility,
            severity and/or immunity that is likely to have an impact on the epidemiological situation in the EU/EEA.
            The combined genomic, epidemiological, and in-vitro evidence for these properties invokes at least moderate
            confidence.
            In addition, all the criteria for variants of interest and under monitoring outlined below apply.

          <strong>Variants of Interest (VOI)</strong>
          <p>
            For these variants, evidence is available on genomic properties, epidemiological evidence or in-vitro
            evidence
            that could imply a significant impact on transmissibility, severity and/or immunity, realistically having an
            impact on the epidemiological situation in the EU/EEA. However, the evidence is still preliminary or is
            associated
            with major uncertainty. In addition, all the criteria for variants under monitoring outlined below apply.
