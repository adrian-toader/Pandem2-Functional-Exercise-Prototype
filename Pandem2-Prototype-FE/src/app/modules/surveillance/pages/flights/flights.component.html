          <p>Flightradar24 is a global flight tracking service that provides you with real-time information about thousands of aircraft around the world.</p>
          <p>Flightradar24 is a flight tracker that shows live air traffic from around the world. Flightradar24 combines data from several data sources including ADS-B, MLAT and radar data. The ADS-B, MLAT and radar data is aggregated together with schedule and flight status data from airlines and airports to create a unique flight tracking experience</p>
          <p>In areas where Flightradar24 normally have coverage, all major airports are marked with blue airport markers.</p>
          <p>Please note that coverage and aircraft visibility is dependent of many parameters including aircraft type, aircraft transponder type, aircraft altitude and terrain, so coverage can be different for different aircraft, even on the same location. If an aircraft you are looking for is not visible on Flightradar24 it either does not have a compatible transponder or it's out of Flightradar24 coverage.</p>
