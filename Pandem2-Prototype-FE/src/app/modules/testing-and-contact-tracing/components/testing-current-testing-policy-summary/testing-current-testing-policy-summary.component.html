        The figure shows the number of positive tests reported in the preceding 24 hours. The date attributed to positive
        tests is the date on which the relevant organisation was notified by the relevant health authority. This is not
        the same as the date on which people are tested. Part of the notification process is done manually. Sometimes the
        health authority will not have reported all newly confirmed cases at the moment that the figures are compiled for
        the preceding 24 hours. Missing notifications are passed on at a later time. Missing or delayed notifications can
        skew the daily figures. The rolling average filters out this type of fluctuation, and therefore often gives a
        better picture of the number of infections.

          OxCGRT collects publicly available information on indicators of government response. These indicators take
          policies such as school closuers, travel bans, etc.
          and record them on an ordinal scale. The remainder is financial indicators, such as fiscal or monetary measures.
